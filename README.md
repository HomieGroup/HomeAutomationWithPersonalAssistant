# HomeAutomationWithPersonalAssistant
A “Smart Home” is a part of the IoT paradigm and aims to integrate home automation. Allowing objects and devices in a home to be connected to the Internet enables users to remotely monitor and control them. These include light switches that can be turned on and off by using a smartphone or by voice command. 

A Personal Voice Assistant is a technology based on AI. The software uses a device’s microphone to receive voice requests while the voice output takes place at the speaker. But the most exciting thing happens between these two actions. 

A Home Automation is the ability to do tasks automatically and monitor remotely technology based on IoT. Common tasks include turning on/off lights via Smartphone or Voice over. It is a combination of several different technologies: voice recognition, voice analysis and language processing. It is completely developed in Raspberry Pi using one of the most powerful language python-3.
